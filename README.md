# YourClock

YourClock presents original units of time that are of relevance to the user. Learn how many seconds you have been alive, your age on exoplanets, and the distance you have traveled through the Milkyway. From red blood cell counts to cheetah miles to black hole rotations, there is something for everyone. Send text cards to loved ones, and save dates for parties. Exclusively available on the iOS App Store.

Note: App migrated from BitBucket.
